          <p>
            At The Vehicle Audit, we are dedicated to providing comprehensive
            and reliable Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) reports to assist
            our users in making informed decisions. Due to the nature of our
            digital services and the immediate delivery of sensitive vehicle
            data, we uphold a strict no-refund policy once a report has been
            generated and delivered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each VIN report is uniquely generated using the specific vehicle
            information provided by the customer. As the report contains
            proprietary and third-party data that is delivered instantly, no
            refunds will be issued after the report has been accessed, viewed,
            or downloaded, regardless of user satisfaction or usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the sole responsibility of the customer to ensure the VIN and
            all other submitted information are accurate before confirming the
            purchase. Reports generated using incorrect VINs or details are not
            eligible for refunds under any circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you encounter any technical difficulty that prevents you from
            receiving the report, you must contact us within 24 hours of your
            purchase. We will assess the issue and provide assistance to ensure
            that your report is delivered correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Vehicle Audit reserves the right to deny refund requests
            suspected to be fraudulent, abusive, or in violation of our terms of
            service. By proceeding with a purchase on our platform, you
            acknowledge and agree to the conditions outlined in this Refund
            Policy.

            NMVTIS Consumer Access Product Disclaimer
          </h2>
          <p>
            The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) is an
            electronic system that contains information on certain automobiles
            titled in the United States. It serves as a reliable source of title
            and brand history for vehicles but does not provide detailed
            information about a vehicle’s repair history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Federal law requires states, insurance companies, and junk and
            salvage yards to regularly report data to NMVTIS. However, not all
            motor vehicles are covered, as some states are still not providing
            their data to the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            NMVTIS may not include records of significant vehicle damage if the
            vehicle was never declared a “total loss” by an insurance company or
            branded by a state titling agency. On the other hand, an insurance
            company may be required to report a “total loss” even if the state
            has not branded the vehicle as “salvage” or “junk.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A vehicle history report from NMVTIS is not a substitute for an
            independent vehicle inspection. Consumers are encouraged to have
            vehicles independently inspected to check for hidden damage.
